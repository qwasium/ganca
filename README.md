**STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

This project is still under development.

Thare can be any changes in the future.

This project is public in order to make the development process transparent.

No pull requests will be accepted until the beta version is released.

## What is ganca?

ganca is a simple and fast eye-tracking data analysis tool.

## When is it coming?

Alpha version is planned to be released in Jan. 2024, but can be delayed.

The following features are planned to be implemented in the alpha version.

- Heatmap using Kernel Density Estimation
- Heatmap using Gauss Sum
- Gazepath plot()
- Simple IAT fixation filter
- Simple IVT fixation filter


I have a rough goal of releasing the beta version somewhere in spring 2024, but I can't promise anything.

Beta version and later versions will be released on PyPI and CRAN.

The following features are considered to be implemented in the beta version.

- Heatmap using particle filter
- Heatmap using Gaussian Process
- parallel processing


## MATLAB?

I'm not planning to release a built version for MATLAB.

Users will need to build the package by themselves.

I won't have a MATLAB license from April 2024, so I can't support it.
